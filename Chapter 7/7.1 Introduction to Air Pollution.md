# 7.1 Introduction to Air Pollution
**Air pollution**: anything in atmosphere that is harmful to humans or the environment

**Primary pollutants**: Emitted directly to atmosphere

**Secondary pollutants**: Form in atmosphere, usually by combining with water vapor or other atmospheric gases.

**Criteria pollutants** (most harmful to human health):
- Sulfur dioxide
- Particulate matter
- Lead
- Ozone
- Nitrogen dioxide
- Carbon monoxide

The **clean air act** has been effective in reducing these criteria pollutants.

**Lead impacts**:
- Children
	- anemia
	- lowered IQ
	- reading and learning disabilities
	- nerve damage
- Adults
	- hypertension
	- cardiovascular disease

- Combustion of FFs releases fossil carbon
- Coal contains other elements that are also released when combustion – this is what makes coal especially bad

**Coal formation**: Plant matter -> Peat -> Lignite -> bituminous -> Anthracite (later in the cycle = cleaner coal)

**Impurities**:
- sulfur
	- mainly when in marine environments
- Toxic metals
	- lead 
	- mercury
	- nickel
	- arsenic
- Soot
	- particular matter
		- PM contains these metals and carries them into our lungs

NOx -> Ozone (photochemical smog), nitric acid (acid rain)

Impact on humans:
- lung 
- eyes
- nose throat
