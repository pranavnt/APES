# 4.1 Plate Tectonics

**Convergent**: Plates push toward each other, this releases magma, and volvcanos form here
**Divergent**: plates push away from each other – ridges or volcanoes, sefloor spreading
**Transform**: Plates slide past each other, no ridges/volcanes, tend to have shallow, frequent earthquakes

Earth is made of layers:
- Lithosphere (crust)
- Asthenosphere (upper mantle)
- Mesosphere (lower mantle)

Earthquake formation:
- occur at plate boudnaries
- fault lines lock up – build up stress/energy
- energy releases, causing an earthquake

Earthquake -> Tsunamis 
- long sea wave
- also caused by underwater landslides
